## 📌 Overview:

Welcome to the **Wisesight Architecture Design Challenge**!

This challenge is designed to **assess your ability to design architecture**.

What we are really interested in is:  
✅ **Your thought process**—how you analyze and approach the problem.  
✅ **Your decision-making**—which tools, patterns, or styles you choose.  
✅ **Your trade-off analysis**—why you picked this approach over others.

This challenge will give us insight into **how you structure, refactor, and adapt** an API with real-world constraints.

## 🔥 What You'll Be Doing:

You will be working with a not-so-complex existing API that needs architectural improvement.

Your task is to refactor the API while focusing on:

Clarity in design decisions rather than a single "correct" solution.
Separation of concerns and maintainability.
Making the system more scalable, testable, and modular.

💡 Feel free to use AI, automation, or any tools that help you.
We care about the final architecture and your decision-making, not how you get there.

🚀 Submission Guidelines
1️⃣ Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wisesight/wisesight-architecture-design-test.git
cd wisesight-architecture-design-test
```

2️⃣ Create a new branch with your name

```
git checkout -b <your-name>
```

3️⃣ Refactor the API following best architectural practices

4️⃣ Commit and push your changes

```
git add .
git commit -m "Refactored API - <your-name>"
git push origin <your-name>
```

5️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch

## 📌 Next Steps

In the next interview session, we will discuss your decisions and review your code together.

Be prepared to:

🔹 Explain your reasoning behind architectural choices.

🔹 Answer follow-up questions about trade-offs and scalability.

🔹 Discuss how you would adapt the architecture for different scenarios.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
